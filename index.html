        <h3> <a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to BbSync.org</h3>
        <p>BbSync.org is an Apache-licensed, open source project that allows Java developers with no web service programming experience to create functional web service client applications that interact with Blackboard Learn&#8482;.</p>
       
       <!--
        <pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>
-->
       <h3> <a></a>Why BbSync.org?</h3>
       <p>Blackboard Learn&#8482; ships with a rich set of default web services that allow web service clients to interact with most of Learn's core functionality. &nbsp;That is, these client web services are essentially a subset of Blackboard Learn's Building Blocks&#8482; functionality that can be run on a remote computer. &nbsp;This includes the ability to create/update/delete users, courses, and memberships - as well as many other increadibly useful functions.</p>
       <p>Unfortunately, many people have found that getting started with these web services is difficult at best. Much of the documentation that exists for Learn's web services is quite dated and the sample code provided with Learn can be extremely difficult to understand.</p>
       <p>BbSync.org is more than just code. &nbsp;It is an attempt to:</p>
       <ol>
       <li>Provide easy-to-use, accessible code that is backed by easy-to-understand, functioning tests.</li>
       <li>Provide usefull documentation and tutorials for working with Blackboard Learn's web services.</li>
       <li>Promote a community of Blackboard Learn web service developers and contributers.</li>
       </ol>
       <p><strong><em>Community</em></strong> is the most important part of this equation. &nbsp;That's why this project is on GitHub. &nbsp;Through GitHub, everyone will be able to fork their own copy of this project and contribute back to the original. &nbsp;If you're not familiar with how to do this, please watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8GBXvdmHT4" target="_blank">introductory video on GitHub basics</a>. </p>
       <h3> <a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How Does it work?</h3>
       <p>BbSync.org objects implement a uniform web service client object interface in order to simplify how you work with individual Blackboard Learn&#8482; web service objects. </p>
       <p><ul>
         <li><strong>persist():Serializable</strong> - creates or updates a web service object.</li>
         <li><strong>retrieve():Object</strong> - gets a web service object.</li>
         <li><strong>delete():boolean</strong> - deletes a web service object.</li>
       </ul>
       </p>
       <p> For instance, to create a simple course in Blackboard Learn&#8482; using BbSync.org, all you would need to do is this: </p>
       <pre><code>
       BbCourse bb_course = new BbCourse();
       bb_course.setCourseId("tst_prst_crs");
       bb_course.setName("Test Persist Course");
       String id = (String) bb_course.persist();
       </code></pre>
       </p>
       <p>To get the course in the example above from your Blackboard Learn&#8482; server,  do this: </p>
       <pre><code>
        BbCourse bb_course = new BbCourse();
        bb_course.setId(id);
        bb_course = (BbCourse) bb_course.retrieve();
       </code></pre>
       </p>

       <p>Finally, to delete the course in the example above, do this: </p>
       <pre><code>
        BbCourse bb_course = new BbCourse();
        bb_course.setId(id);
        bb_course.delete();
       </code></pre>
       </p>
		<p>Using BbSync.org, the same basic pattern can be applied to all of the Blackboard Learn&#8482; web service client objects such as users, memberships, terms, etc.  Plus there's a whole lot more to BbSync.org that should make working with Blackboard Learn&#8482 web services easier than ever before.</p>
